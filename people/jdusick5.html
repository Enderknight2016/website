    <p>There once was a dog who was scared of spiders. One day he decided to go for a walk. He walked and he walked for a long time until he came to a barn. He had never seen the barn before but he went inside. Once inside the door closed behind him and he was enveloped in darkness. He was scared, scared there would be a spider in the barn. There was, he was spooked and ran out of the barn to his home and never left again. The end.</p>
