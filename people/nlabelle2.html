    <h1>Nicholas LaBelle and a cute puppy.</h1>
    <p>The year is 2055 and the day is quite rife with temperment. I see a cute little puppy on the sidewalk with temperatures in the high 90s. I decide to bring the puppy inside. I live in a trying time but compassion for that puppy remains. Even if the world is shattering would you care for the cute little puppy on the sidewalk. Whether we are burning with heat or in the cold we are compassionate.</p>
